# SC01-Plus-speedometer
From the fantastic example of "@thatproject"
based on Squareline studio design.
This project is not mine, I just follow the example and modify the code. This code is not working as speedometer, it's just visual effect with statics data.
If you want to realise the full project, this is the links you should follow:

Unfortunately, I was never able to make it work directly from this repo on my SC01 plus so I've decideed to upload my code.
Thank you also to www.moduleplus.com for their help, after a wrong upload, the card was not working (rebooting every seconds). they could help me to find a way out. If you need to buy the SC01 plus or anything else, they have great support.

This repo is based on Platform IO but can probably be uploaded from Arduino IDE with minor modifications.

Enjoy.
